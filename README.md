ICT stands for _Information and Communication Technology_. I was fortunate enough to give a talk at the **ICT for Quality Research in Education: Concerns, Issues and Challenges** held in my hometown at Chhotu Ram College of Education, Rohtak on 14th October 2018. The topic of my talk was **Targeting Indian Census 2021: Systematic Approaches for Reliable and Efficient Data Collection**.
